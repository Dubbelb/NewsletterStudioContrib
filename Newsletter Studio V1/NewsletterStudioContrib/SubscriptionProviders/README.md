Subscription providers
=======================

A subscription provider can be used to fetch subscribers from custom sources ie. custom database tables, files on disk, web services or what ever. This repo contains some examples of providers that you can use "as is" or use as a starting-point and customize it in you own way.

uWebshop

No need for a custom provider as all customers are stored as Umbraco members.

DownloadSubscriptionProvider
----------------------------
 This class demonstrates a simple approach do implement a custom subscription provider that downloads the list of emails from an external web-page. Probably not a real world scenario so think of this class more as a demonstration of what can be done.
